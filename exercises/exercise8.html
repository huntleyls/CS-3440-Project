   <h2>Brief Biography</h2>

   <p>
         My Name is Drake Scott, I am from Swansboro North Carolina. Right Now I am a sponsored Duck Hunter. 
      I have sponsorships with <abbr>Sitka</abbr> and <abbr>Remington</abbr> I've been duck hunting since I was little. 
      We are going on two major sponsored hunts this year one in Beaufort N.C. The other is in Baton rouge Louisiana.
   </p>
   <p>
      Growing up we hunted every weekend fall and spring deer duck turkey, if you can name it we hunt it. 
      As long as I can remember I've been hunting with my family, which leads to another passion of mine which is cooking. 
      I love to cook it's a way to show the people you love that you care and engage them in new experiences with flavors and tastes. 
      I enjoy cooking, so much.
   </p>
   <p>
      A little background about me: I have 3 siblings, two biological, and one adopted. I have 6 dogs and 
      I love them more than anything. I also play rugby and enjoy fishing. 
   </p>

   <h2>Career Goals</h2>
   <p>
         With my degree in computer science I plan to work at cabelas in their web design department. 
      I had my internship there last year and now have a job offer. I am also interested in working 
      for the <strong>TBI</strong>(Tennessee bureau of investigation. With either one of these paths I would be happy with it.
